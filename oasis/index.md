Oasis is the core for a complete tabletop RPG system. It provides all of the rules required to resolve actions, run both social & combat encounters, travel, vehicles and perform character creation. However, it doesn't provide content for these systems, such as monsters to fight, abilities for characters to choose or weapons. This is to encourage reuse and extension.

This core system is designed for use in hyper-dangerous sci-fi cosmic-horror worlds with, relative to other systems, low power characters and no player-accesible magic. The deadliness/power if you were to put it on a 1-7 scale, between Call of Cthulhu and Dungeons and Dragons it, would be a 3. For comparison, Delta Green would be a 2 on that scale.

### Boilerplate design abstract

Oasis utilizes a One-Roll Engine like resolution mechanic, utilizing stat-based d12 pools to generate bivariant roll outcomes. 

Characters have a fixed health-pool and are skill-based, attribute-lite, classless and leveless. They are generated through a lifepath system and mechanical advacement is achieved through a Shadowrun-like point buy system with supplemental in-world augumentation options. 

Combat is designed to quickly death-spiral and utilizes a sliding initiative system, where actions adjust your initiative in real-time. To-hit difficulty shouldn't vary between characters, but they can either react to force opposed rolls (pushing their initiative down) or let their armour absorb some of the damage. Choosing battles and being prepared is the key to avoiding character death.
